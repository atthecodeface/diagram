; a desired geometry is a rectangular bounding box with a reference point (usually within that)
; A rotation, scaling and translation may be applied to this
; This leads to a new, axis-aligned rectangular bounding box which may not include the reference point
; This has margin, border, and padding applied to lead to a new box
